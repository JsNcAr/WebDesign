			Gilgameš and Ḫuwawa (Version A)<br><br>
				

			1-3. Now the lord once decided to set off for the mountain where the man lives; Lord Gilgameš decided to set off for the mountain where the man lives. He spoke to his slave Enkidu:<br><br>

			4-7. "Enkidu, since a man cannot pass beyond the final end of life, I want to set off into the mountains, to establish my renown there. Where renown can be established there, I will establish my renown; and where no renown can be established there, I shall establish the renown of the gods."<br><br>

			8-12. His slave Enkidu answered him: "My lord, if today you are going to set off into the mountains, Utu should know about it from us. {(1 ms. adds:) If you are going to to set off into the Mountains of Cedar-felling, Utu should know about it from us.} Utu, youthful Utu, should know about it from us. A decision that concerns the mountains is Utu's business. A decision that concerns the Mountains of Cedar-felling is the business of youthful Utu. Utu should know about it from us."<br><br>

			13-16. Gilgameš {prepared} {(2 mss. have instead:) took hold of} a white kid. {He clasped a brown kid, a sacrificial animal, close to his breast.} {(1 ms. has instead:) He …… a brown kid.} In his hand he held a holy staff before his nose, as he addressed Utu of heaven:<br><br>

			17-18. "Utu, I am going to set off into the mountains! May you be my helper! I am going to set off into the Mountains of Cedar-felling! May you be my helper!"<br>
			</p>

			<p id="gilga_fin">
			19-20. From heaven Utu replied to him: "Young man, you are noble already in your own right -- but what would you want with the mountains?"</p>
